Diagnosis of myocardial iscaemia is difficult in patients with left-bundle branch block og paced ventricular rhtyhm.
First discribed by Elena Sgarbossa in 1996 the electrocardiografic:

he original three criteria used to diagnose infarction in patients with LBBB are:

Concordant ST elevation > 1mm in leads with a positive QRS complex (score 5)
Concordant ST depression > 1 mm in V1-V3 (score 3)
Excessively discordant ST elevation > 5 mm in leads with a -ve QRS complex (score 2).
These criteria are specific, but not sensitive for myocardial infarction. A total score of  â‰¥ 3 is reported to have a specificity of 90% for diagnosing myocardial infarction.
