A look on Engauge Digitizer for efficiently conversion of paper ECGs to readable research data.
<!--more-->

In the following I will review *Engague Digitizer* for conversion of paper ECG into data points.

In the Clinical environment today, most ECGs are still recorded and printed on paper, and subsequently scanned
to the electronic patient's record. In a clinical perspective, electronic recording of the ECG would make it easy
to calculate clinical variables, e.g. QT-interval and ST-segment changes. Additionally, researchers using ECG Data
are likely to prefer an electronic ECG rather than a scanned PDF or using the old ruler.

However, as I am currently conducting a study in a clinic without electronic ECG recording, a feasible workflow for
the conversion to readable data is very warrented.

*Engague Digitizer* is developed and maintained by [Mark Mitchell](https://github.com/markummitchell).
