On May 8th I was invite to attend a panel debate on the question: _"Who is a good supervisor?"_

The debate was a part of the student encounter research dating by [Society for Medical Student Research at Aarhus University](/wwww.studenterforskning.dk/).
I attended together with professor Steen Dalby Kristensen, Department of Cardiology at Aarhus University Hospital.
