#Background and hypothesis
#Methods
##Study setting
The [ELECTRODE] study is a prospective, randomized, investor-initiated, muliticenter clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of anterior-posterior electrode position versus anterior-lateral electrode position in cardioverting atrial fibrillation. The study is conducted in out-patient clinics at Danish hospitals: Viborg Regional Hospital and Randers Regional Hospital, Denmark [list of recuiting sites]. 

##Intervension
Patients will be randomized to recieve biphasic cardioversion shocks using: 1) Anterior-posterior electrode position; or 2) Anterior-lateral electrode position. The inclusion and allocation of treatment is illustrated in Figure 1.

Cardioversion shocks will be applied until sinus rhythm or to a maximum of three shocks using Life 20 (biphasic truncated exponential shocks), Physio-Control Inc., USA. All patient will be cardioverted using an escalating shock protocol of 100-200-360 J. The shocks will be administered through self-adhesive gel electrodes. 

##Randomization
##Study population
Patients
All patients sheduled for elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation are eligible for screeing. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Table 1. 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
table1 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Inclusion.criteria,                        ~Exclusion.criteria, ~c............,
                "ECG",                 "Hemodynamically unstable",             NA,
      "Age >18 years", "Other arrythmia than atrial fibrillation",             NA,
                   NA,                                         NA,             NA
  )

              kable(table1, digits = 3, row.names = FALSE, align = "c",
              caption = NULL, format = "latex"),
        latex_options = c("striped", "basic"),
        position = "center", full_width = FALSE)

Patients are required to receive sufficient anticoagulation, i.e. have a documented weekly international normalized ratio (INR) of more or 2.0 (including within 48 hours of cardioversion) or treatment with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant for three weeks or longer. Alternatively, a transoesophageal echocardiogram documenting the absence of intra-cardiac thrombi is accepted and cardioversion can be performed on treatment with low molecular weight heparin. All patients will be discharged with a recommendation for therapeutic anticoagulation according to current guidelines [REF]. 

#Ethics
All participants are required to give informed consent prior to enrollment. The pre-cardioversion check is the first contact to patients, and here they will receive oral and written information about the study. The oral and written information will be given by a study investigator. The information will be given in a quiet setting, and the patients may ask questions about the study. It will be possible for the patient to have a companion present. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants during the pre-cardioversion check or alternatively prior to cardioversion allowing the patient to have a companion present before consent is given. Patients declining to participate in the study will receive treatment according to hospital standard care. The study is conducted in accordance with national requirements and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and The Danish Health Act.
